# Wizard Wars
### _A CSE201 Project_

This is the repository for our video game Wizard Wars that is heavily inspired by (or a straight up clone) [Magicka: Wizard Wars](https://magicka.fandom.com/wiki/Wizard_Wars). The game will be implemented using the fantastic game library [Allegro](www.liballeg.org), which is provided free for us to use. Please note that Allegro is a low-ish level library as opposed to a game engine, so there is less stuff to learn and more leeway for us to create the game as we like.

Please do this tutorial https://github.com/liballeg/allegro_wiki/wiki/Allegro-Vivace
Please also read this AND always implement all drawing stuff with the streched buffer method:
